# Code Challenge: Cypress Test Suite for a Booking Site

## Description

This project is a Cypress test suite for a booking site. It includes tests for the entire booking flow, from selecting a departure location to verifying the purchase completion.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* You have installed the latest version of [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
* You have a `<Windows/Linux/Mac>` machine. State here which OSes are supported and which are not.

## Installing the Project

To install the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd <project_directory>
    ```
3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running the tests

To run the tests, you have two options:

### Option 1: Using the Cypress Test Runner

Follow these steps:

1. Start the Cypress test runner:
    ```bash
    npx cypress open
    ```
2. In the Cypress test runner, click on the `main-test.cy.js` file to start the tests.

### Option 2: Using the Command Line

Follow these steps:

1. Run the tests in the command line:
    ```bash
    npx cypress run
    ```
2. Check the reported results in the command line output.
3. Detailed test reports can be found in the `cypress/reports` directory.

### Option 3: Using GitHub Actions (Under construction)

1. Navigate to the "Actions" tab of the repository on GitHub.
2. Manually trigger the tests.
3. The tests will be executed by GitHub Actions after the workflow is triggered.
4. View the test results in the "Actions" tab of the repository on GitHub.
5. Download artifacts such as test reports and videos from the "Actions" tab after the tests have completed.

## Project Structure

This Cypress project is structured as follows:

- `cypress`: This is the main directory for all Cypress related files.
    - `fixtures`: This directory is used to manage fixtures. Fixtures are used as external pieces of static data that can be used by your tests.
    - `support`: This directory is used to share behavior across different test files.
    - `page-objects`: This directory contains the page object models which abstract the details of the UI structure and isolate the changes in the UI from the test logic.
    - `reports`: This directory contains the test reports generated by the `cypress-mochawesome-reporter`.
    - `screenshots`: This directory contains the screenshots taken when a test fails.
    - `videos`: This directory contains the videos of the test runs.
- `.github/workflows`: This directory contains the GitHub Actions workflow files.
- `node_modules`: This directory contains all the npm dependencies of the project.
- `package.json`: This file contains the list of project dependencies and scripts.
- `cypress.json`: This file is used to store the Cypress configuration.

## Page Object Model (POM) Structure

The Page Object Model (POM) is a design pattern that can be used in test automation for enhancing test maintenance and reducing code duplication. A page object is an object-oriented class that serves as an interface to a page of your application. The tests then use these page objects to interact with the application.

In this project, the POM is structured as follows:

- `page-objects`: This directory contains the page object models which abstract the details of the UI structure and isolate the changes in the UI from the test logic.
    - `main-page.js`: This page object represents the main page of the application and includes methods for selecting departure and destination locations, choosing a travel date, and clicking the search button.
    - `search-page.js`: This page object represents the search results page and includes a method for choosing a trip from the displayed options.
    - `purchase-seats-page.js`: This page object represents the page where the user selects their seat and includes methods for choosing an available seat and clicking the continue button.
    - `purchase-passenger-page.js`: This page object represents the page where the user enters passenger details and includes a method for filling out the passenger form.
    - `purchase-payment-page.js`: This page object represents the page where the user enters payment information and includes a method for filling out the payment form.
    - `purchase-complete-page.js`: This page object represents the page that confirms the purchase was successful and includes a method for verifying the purchase completion.

The tests in the `cypress/tests` directory use these page objects to interact with the application. For example, the `main-test.cy.js` file imports the page objects and uses their methods to perform actions on the application and assert that the expected results are achieved. This approach makes the tests more readable and maintainable, and any changes in the UI can be handled by simply updating the relevant page object.
